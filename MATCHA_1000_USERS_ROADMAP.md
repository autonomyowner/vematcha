## 1. The Math: Reverse Engineering 1,000 Users

### Conversion Funnel Assumptions

```
Traffic Source → Website Visit → Free Trial → Paid Conversion

Industry Benchmarks for Mental Health SaaS:
- Landing page → Free trial: 5-8%
- Free trial → Paid: 10-15%
- Overall: 0.5-1.2% of traffic converts to paid
```

### Working Backward from 1,000 Paid Users

**Conservative Scenario (1% overall conversion):**
```
1,000 paid users needed
÷ 12% trial-to-paid conversion
= 8,333 free trials needed
÷ 6% landing page conversion
= 138,888 website visitors needed
÷ 90 days
= 1,543 visitors/day average
```

**Optimistic Scenario (with warm traffic from content):**
```
1,000 paid users needed
÷ 15% trial-to-paid conversion (warm audience)
= 6,667 free trials needed
÷ 8% landing page conversion (with social proof)
= 83,333 website visitors needed
÷ 90 days
= 926 visitors/day average
```

### Realistic Target: Blended Approach

| Channel | Traffic Goal | Conv. Rate | Trials | Paid Users |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| TikTok/Reels | 40,000 | 0.8% | 320 | 48 |
| YouTube | 25,000 | 1.5% | 375 | 56 |
| LinkedIn | 10,000 | 2% | 200 | 40 |
| Reddit | 15,000 | 1.2% | 180 | 27 |
| Product Hunt | 8,000 | 3% | 240 | 48 |
| Paid Ads | 12,000 | 1% | 120 | 18 |
| Referrals | 5,000 | 4% | 200 | 60 |
| Email/SEO | 10,000 | 2% | 200 | 40 |
| Partnerships | 8,000 | 3% | 240 | 48 |
| Viral Content | 50,000 | 0.5% | 250 | 38 |
| **TOTAL** | **183,000** | **1.2% avg** | **2,325** | **423** |

**Gap to 1,000:** Need 2.4x multiplier through:
- Viral moments (3-5 pieces hitting 500K+ views)
- Referral program (each user brings 0.5 users)
- Community/word-of-mouth acceleration
- Conversion rate optimization

### Monthly Targets

| Month | Visitors | Trials | Paid | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|--------|------|------------|
| Month 1 | 30,000 | 400 | 60 | 60 |
| Month 2 | 60,000 | 900 | 180 | 240 |
| Month 3 | 120,000 | 2,500 | 760 | 1,000 |

**Key Insight:** Month 3 requires exponential growth from viral content and referrals compounding.

## 6. LinkedIn B2B Strategy

### Target Audiences on LinkedIn

1. **Therapists/Counselors:** Position as tool to extend their practice
2. **Life Coaches:** AI assistant for their clients between sessions
3. **HR/People Ops:** Employee mental health benefit
4. **Corporate Wellness:** B2B pilot programs
5. **Mental Health Advocates:** Amplifiers and partners

### Content Strategy

#### Post Type 1: Personal Vulnerability + Professional Insight
**Frequency:** 2x/week
**Goal:** Build trust, humanize brand

**Example Post:**
```
I burned out building a mental health app.

The irony isn't lost on me.

Last month I was working 80-hour weeks on Matcha,
obsessing over features while ignoring my own mental health.

Then one of our beta users sent me this message:
"Your app helped me notice I was catastrophizing
about work. But are YOU using it?"

That hit different.

Here's what I learned from being forced to use my own product:

1. I had 3 cognitive biases running my decisions daily
2. My "productive" habits were actually avoidance
3. The voice in my head wasn't mine - it was fear

Now I schedule time to use Matcha like any other meeting.

Building mental health tech while ignoring your mental health
is like a chef who never eats.

What's the thing you teach others but forget to do yourself?

---
Matcha is an AI that catches cognitive biases in real-time.
If you're building while burning out, link in comments.
```

#### Post Type 2: Data/Research Insights
**Frequency:** 1x/week
**Goal:** Establish expertise, attract B2B

**Example Post:**
```
We analyzed 5,000 conversations in our AI therapy app.

Here are the 5 most common cognitive biases by industry:

TECH:
Imposter syndrome + All-or-nothing thinking

HEALTHCARE:
Should statements + Emotional reasoning

FINANCE:
Catastrophizing + Fortune telling

CREATIVE:
Disqualifying positives + Personalization

EDUCATION:
Mind reading + Overgeneralization

The pattern? High-achievers share the same mental traps.

The solution isn't working harder - it's thinking differently.

What bias do you see most in your industry?

### B2B Pitch Framework

**For Therapists:**
```
Subject: AI assistant for your clients between sessions

Hi [Name],

I noticed you specialize in [CBT/anxiety/etc]. I built something
that might interest you.

Matcha is an AI therapy assistant that helps clients track
cognitive biases between sessions. Think of it as "homework
that actually gets done."

A few therapists are using it to:
- Keep clients engaged between sessions
- Get insights on patterns before appointments
- Extend support without extending hours

Would you be open to a free trial for yourself or a client?
No pitch, just curious if this is useful.

```

**For HR/Corporate:**
```
Subject: Mental health benefit that costs less than one resignation

Hi [Name],

Replacing one employee costs 50-200% of their salary.
Employee burnout is the #1 reason people quit.

We're piloting Matcha with companies who want to offer
meaningful mental health support beyond a meditation app.

The difference: AI-powered cognitive behavioral therapy
with real clinical backing.

Currently offering free pilots for companies under 100 people.
Is this worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Reddit Content Strategy

#### Rule #1: Be a Person First
- Build genuine karma in communities for 2-4 weeks before any mention
- Comment helpfully on 5-10 posts daily
- Share personal experiences (if comfortable)
- Never lead with product

#### Comment Templates (Value-First)

**For anxiety posts:**
```
This sounds really overwhelming. Something that helped me
was learning about "catastrophizing" - it's when our brain
takes one scenario and spirals it into worst-case outcomes.

What helped: Every time I notice myself spiraling, I ask
"What's the evidence this will actually happen?"

It doesn't fix everything, but it creates a pause.

Sending good thoughts your way.
```

**For self-improvement posts:**
```
Congrats on wanting to make changes - that's literally
the hardest part.

One thing I learned: motivation follows action, not the
other way around. Start stupidly small.

Want to meditate? Start with 1 minute.
Want to exercise? Start with 5 pushups.
Want to journal? Start with 1 sentence.

Your brain will resist anything it perceives as hard.
Make it so easy it feels silly not to do it.
```

#### Long-Form Post Templates

**1. Personal Story Post (r/Anxiety, r/mentalhealth)**
```
Title: How I finally understood why I couldn't "just relax"

For years, people told me to "just calm down" or
"stop overthinking." I thought I was broken.

Then I learned about cognitive biases in therapy -
specifically something called "mind reading" where you
assume you know what others think (usually negative).

I didn't have an anxiety disorder (well, I did).
I had a THINKING disorder. My brain was running
flawed software.

The game-changer was learning to identify WHICH bias
was active in the moment:
- "Everyone thinks I'm weird" → Mind reading
- "This will definitely go wrong" → Fortune telling
- "I'm a complete failure" → All-or-nothing thinking

Once I could name it, I could question it.

Anyone else find that labeling thoughts helps reduce
their power?
```

**2. Resource/Guide Post (r/CBT, r/therapy)**
```
Title: The 20 cognitive biases (with examples and
counter-questions for each)

I've been studying CBT for [X months/years] and wanted
to share a resource I wish I had earlier.

[Detailed list of 20 biases with examples]

For each bias, the key question to ask yourself:
1. What's the evidence?
2. Would I say this to a friend?
3. What's another explanation?
4. What's the worst that could realistically happen?

Hope this helps someone.
```

**3. AMA Post (after building credibility)**
```
Title: I built an AI that detects cognitive biases - AMA

Hi r/[subreddit],

I'm [name], and I spent the last [X] building Matcha,
an AI that helps identify cognitive distortions in
real-time conversations.

Background: [Brief personal story]

Why AI: [Accessibility angle - waitlists, cost, stigma]

Happy to answer questions about:
- How AI detects biases
- The CBT research we used
- Building in the mental health space
- Mental health tech ethics
- My own journey

Proof: [Link to site, LinkedIn, etc.]

Fire away!
```

### Natural Product Mentions

**Only mention product when:**
1. Someone specifically asks for app/tool recommendations
2. Your product genuinely solves their stated problem
3. You've already established presence in that community
4. You disclose it's your product

**Format when mentioning:**
```
"I actually built something for this exact problem
(full disclosure - it's my company). It's called Matcha
and it [specific feature that addresses their need].
Happy to share more if helpful, but also totally get
if you'd rather try other approaches first."
```

Hi Product Hunt!

Would love your feedback!
```

**First Comment (Post immediately after launching):**
```
Hey PH!

First, thanks for checking out Matcha.

Quick backstory: I spent 3 years in CBT therapy.
The biggest insight? Most of my anxiety came from
5-6 cognitive biases I kept repeating unconsciously.

The problem was - recognizing them in real-time is
HARD. Even after years of practice.

So I built Matcha to be the "bias spotter" I wished
I had. It catches distortions like:
- Catastrophizing
- Mind reading
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Fortune telling
...and 16 more.

What makes it different from ChatGPT or other AI?
→ Trained specifically on CBT frameworks
→ Learns YOUR patterns over time
→ Includes voice and EMDR (not just text)
→ Creates actual clinical-style reports

I'm here all day to answer questions!

And if you try it - please DM me feedback.
Building in public means building with you.

Subject: Did you try voice therapy yet?

[Name],

Quick tip: Try talking instead of typing.

Our voice therapy mode is like having a
conversation with a really good listener.

Go to Settings → Voice Mode → Start talking

Some people find it easier to process out loud.
Try it today.

**Email 3: Day 4**

You've been using Matcha for 4 days.

Just a heads up: Your free trial ends in 24 hours.

So far you've:

**Email 5: Day 7 (Trial ended)**
```
Subject: We saved your data

[Name],

Your trial ended, but your data is saved for 7 days.

I know subscriptions add up. So let me be real:

Matcha costs $19/month.
A single therapy session costs $150-300.

If Matcha helps you catch even ONE destructive
thought pattern, it's paid for itself.

But only you know if it's worth it.

We're here if you decide to continue.

Hey [name],

You cancelled Matcha. I get it.

But I'm curious - what didn't work?

Reply with a number:
1 - Too expensive
2 - Didn't have time to use it
3 - Didn't find it helpful
4 - Going to try human therapy
5 - Something else

Your feedback genuinely helps us improve.

Thanks,

**Email 2: Day 7**

Subject: In case you're reconsidering

## 15. Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks and Contingencies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Content doesn't go viral | High | High | Volume + testing; 100+ pieces before expecting viral |
| Low conversion rate | Medium | High | Aggressive A/B testing; user interviews |
| Product Hunt flops | Medium | Medium | Not dependent on single channel; have backup launch |
| Ad budget runs out | High | Medium | Focus on organic first; ads supplement only |
| Burnout | High | High | Schedule rest days; realistic expectations |
| Copycats | Medium | Low | Move fast; build community moat |
| Platform algorithm changes | Medium | Medium | Diversify platforms; own the email list |
| Mental health liability | Low | High | Clear disclaimers; emergency resources visible |

### If Behind Target at Week 6:

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Where is traffic coming from?
2. Where is traffic dropping off?
3. What content has performed best?
4. What does user feedback say?

**Emergency Actions:**
1. Double content velocity (5x/day on TikTok)
2. Accelerate ad spending (front-load budget)
3. Aggressive outreach (100 DMs/day)
4. Flash sale to convert waitlist
5. Pivot messaging based on what's working
6. Partner blitz (3x outreach velocity)

### If Behind Target at Week 9:

**Major Pivots to Consider:**
1. Freemium model (free tier with paid upgrades)
2. B2B pivot (sell to companies, not individuals)
3. Different pricing ($9/mo to lower friction)
4. Different target audience
5. Add human element (group sessions, office hours)

## Final Notes

### The Truth About 1,000 Users

**It's ambitious.** Most products take 6-12 months to reach 1,000 paid users.

**It's possible** with:
- Full-time dedication (40+ hrs/week)
- High content velocity (3-5x/day on primary platform)
- Relentless iteration based on data
- Some luck (1-2 pieces going viral)
- Strong product-market fit

**The math requires:**
- ~2% conversion from traffic to paid (better than average)
- At least one viral moment (100K+ views)
- Strong referral/word-of-mouth
- Compounding effects in month 3

### Minimum Viable Strategy

If you can only do 3 things:
1. **Post 3x daily on TikTok** (volume wins)
2. **Email everyone you know** (warm network)
3. **Launch on Product Hunt** (one big moment)

### The Real Game

Traffic is vanity. Trials are sanity. **Paid users are reality.**

Focus on:
1. Getting people to TRY the product
2. Making the trial experience incredible
3. Following up obsessively with trial users
4. Listening and iterating rapidly

The content, ads, and partnerships are means to an end.

The end is: **People who pay because Matcha genuinely helps them.**

Build something that helps. Tell people about it. Repeat.
